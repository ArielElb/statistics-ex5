## Explaination :

The pie charts provide insights into the distribution of data within each category. In all three pie charts, the "other" category appears to be the largest segment. This indicates that there are numerous smaller groups within the data that are grouped together under the "other" category. 

Looking specifically at the publisher pie chart, it suggests that there is a relatively low presence of large publishers, as their representation is limited compared to the "other" category. This implies that the majority of publishers are smaller entities or less prominent in the dataset.

In the society pie chart, a significant portion of the data falls under the "no" category. This indicates that many journals in the dataset are not associated with any specific society. It suggests that a substantial number of journals operate independently without being affiliated with a particular society or organization.

The field pie chart reveals that the "General" field is the most common, while the other fields are relatively smaller in comparison. This implies that a majority of journals in the dataset are categorized under the general field, whereas the other specialized fields have a comparatively lower representation.

Moving on to the histograms, they provide a visual representation of the distribution of values for different variables. The price histogram indicates that lower prices are more common, while higher prices are less frequent. This suggests that the majority of journals have lower pricing, with only a few having higher price points.

The pages histogram shows that the average page count tends to center around 500 pages. This suggests that journals in the dataset have an average length of approximately 500 pages.

The characters per page histogram indicates that the average number of characters per page is around 3000. This gives an insight into the typical density or amount of content present on a page in the journals.

In the citations histogram, the majority of journals have citation counts lower than 2000. This implies that most journals in the dataset have a relatively lower number of citations, with only a few having a higher citation count.

The founding year histogram illustrates that as the years progress, there is an increasing number of journals being founded. This suggests that the dataset contains journals from various time periods, and the number of journals founded has been growing over time.

Finally, the subscriptions histogram indicates that most library subscriptions fall below 400, with a higher concentration around 0 rather than 200. This suggests that the majority of library subscriptions are on the lower end, with a significant number of libraries having either no subscriptions or a limited number of subscriptions.

These interpretations provide an overview of the patterns and trends observed in the data based on the pie charts and histograms.

### linear regression :


Based on the given results:

Best Feature: pages
R-squared: 0.32
MSE: 86265.45
The R-squared value of 0.32 indicates that approximately 32% of the variability in the price can be explained by the "pages" feature alone. This means that the "pages" feature has some influence on the price and can provide a moderate level of explanation.

The MSE value of 86265.45 represents the average squared difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices. A lower MSE indicates better model performance, as it means that the predicted prices are closer to the actual prices. In this case, the MSE value of 86265.45 suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 86265.45 units from the actual prices.
